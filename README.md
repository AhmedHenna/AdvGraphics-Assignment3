## Movement
* Since this is a unity VR games using the XR Simulator, we can move the charctaer using the W,A,S,D or if you are using a VR headset using the left analog stick. We can aim/rotate the camera using the arrow keys or the right analog stick on the controller.
* To switch between the two cameras in the scene, we can simulate this by pressing "1" on the keyboard, or by clicking the thumstick on the left oculus controller
* We can enable/disable the postporcessing by pressing on key "I" on the keyboard, or the primary button on the oculus controller
* Flying can be started by pressing on the trigger button on the right oculus controller and aiming your hadn in the direction you wish to fly to

## Animated Object
The animated object's animated path can be altered by looking at the object and pressing the "G" key on the keyboard, or pressing the grip button on the oculus controller

## Post Processing
Post processing can be enabled and disabled using the "I" key. I have applied multiple different techniques to enhance the look of the game and give it a more horror vibe. You can also click the thumstick on the left oculus controller to enable/disable the effects.

## Particle System
I created a ball of lightning in the scene. Interecting with the object, by pressing on "C" will change the color of the particles. You can also interact with it by pressing on the thumstick on the right oculus controller.

## Optimizing Light and Shadow
I have added lightmaps to the a lot of objects in the scene, as well as baked the lights in the entire scene. Making it easier for the scene to render
